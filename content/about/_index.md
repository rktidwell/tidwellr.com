I am an engineer based out of the Twin Cities in the great state of Minnesota. I have many interests that occupy my time, but I enjoy sharing my thoughts and hands-on experiences with technology. Much of what you'll find here will be about networking, which is my passion and first love when it comes to technology. I hope you find it both interesting and useful!
