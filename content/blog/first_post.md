This my first post. Woot!

Seriously though, I'm making it a resolution to post regularly here. Being able to communicate clearly in written form is a powerful skill, one that I want to continue honing. So as much as I want to share, there's also a selfish aspect to trying my hand at blogging. Stay tuned, the first post with some real content to it is comming soon.
